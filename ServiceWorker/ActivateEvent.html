    <h1>Service Worker Activate Event</h1>
    <p>
      The <code>activate</code> event in a Service Worker is fired when the
      Service Worker takes control of the page. This event is used to perform
      tasks such as cleaning up old caches and ensuring that the Service Worker
      is ready to handle fetch events.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Code</h2>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// filepath: /service-worker.js
self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
    console.log('Service Worker activating...');
    // Perform tasks during activation
    event.waitUntil(
        // Example: Cleaning up old caches
        caches.keys().then(cacheNames => {
            return Promise.all(
                cacheNames.map(cacheName => {
                    if (cacheName !== 'my-cache-v1') {
                        console.log('Deleting old cache:', cacheName);
                        return caches.delete(cacheName);
                    }
                })
            );
        })
    );
});
    </code></pre>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
      In the above code, the <code>activate</code> event listener is registered
      using <code>self.addEventListener</code>. Inside the event listener, the
      following activities are performed:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Logging Activation:</strong> A message is logged to the console
        indicating that the Service Worker is activating.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cleaning Up Old Caches:</strong> The
        <code>event.waitUntil</code> method is used to ensure that the
        activation process waits until the provided promise resolves. In this
        case, the promise resolves after all old caches (caches not named
        'my-cache-v1') are deleted.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Additional Activities</h2>
    <p>
      Other activities that can be performed during the
      <code>activate</code> event include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Claiming Clients:</strong> Immediately take control of all
        clients (pages) under the Service Worker's scope using
        <code>self.clients.claim()</code>.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Migrating Data:</strong> Migrate data from old storage formats
        to new ones if necessary.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Claiming Clients Example</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// filepath: /service-worker.js
self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
    event.waitUntil(
        self.clients.claim().then(() => {
            console.log('Service Worker claimed clients.');
        })
    );
});
    </code></pre>

    <h3>What is Claiming Clients?</h3>
    <p>
      When a Service Worker is installed, it doesn't immediately take control of
      the pages that are open. By default, the Service Worker will only control
      pages that are loaded after it is installed. However, you can use the
      <code>self.clients.claim()</code> method to make the Service Worker take
      control of all open pages immediately after it activates. This is useful
      for ensuring that all pages are controlled by the latest version of the
      Service Worker without needing to reload them.
    </p>

    <h3>Real-Life Use Case for Claiming Clients</h3>
    <p>
      Imagine you have a web application that caches assets for offline use.
      When you release a new version of your Service Worker with updated caching
      logic, you want all currently open pages to start using the new caching
      logic immediately. By using <code>self.clients.claim()</code>, you ensure
      that all open pages are controlled by the new Service Worker as soon as it
      activates, providing a consistent experience across all pages without
      requiring users to refresh.
    </p>

    <h3>Migrating Data Example</h3>
    <pre><code class="language-javascript">
// filepath: /service-worker.js
self.addEventListener('activate', event => {
    event.waitUntil(
        // Example: Migrating data
        migrateData().then(() => {
            console.log('Data migration completed.');
        })
    );
});

function migrateData() {
    // Implement data migration logic here
    return Promise.resolve();
}
    </code></pre>

    <h3>What is Migrating Data?</h3>
    <p>
      Data migration involves moving data from one storage format to another.
      This can be necessary when you update the structure of your cached data or
      change the way data is stored in IndexedDB or other storage mechanisms.
    </p>

    <h3>Real-Life Use Case for Migrating Data</h3>
    <p>
      Suppose you have a web application that stores user preferences in
      IndexedDB. In a new version of your app, you decide to change the
      structure of the stored preferences to support new features. During the
      <code>activate</code> event, you can migrate the existing data to the new
      structure, ensuring that users' preferences are preserved and compatible
      with the new version of your app.
